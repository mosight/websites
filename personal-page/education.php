					I am currently persuing my doctoral degree in the department of <a href="http://www.eng.uci.edu/dept/eecs">EECS</a>,
					 Henry Samueli School of Engineering. I am expecting my defence on <b>March, 2014</b>. My adivisor is Prof. 
					 Ozdal Boyraz. My research topics includes silicon waveguide technology, silicon photonics 
					 in mid-IR frequency, non-linear optics and plasmonic flat lens and mirrors.
				</p>

					I also got my Master's Degree from Dept. of EECS, UCI in <b>June, 2010</b>. My coursework was focused
					on circuit and device. I got a GPA of <b>3.9</b> out of 4.0. At the same time, I also took and attended many courses
					from communication system and	computer science. A selection is listed as below:
					<ul>
						<li>Analog Integrated Circuit Design</li>
						<li>Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit Design</li>
						<li>Circuit Design for Broadband/Optical Communications</li>
						<li>Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit</li>
						<li>VLSI Design</li>
						<li>Antenna Design</li>
						<li>Semiconductor Devices</li>
						<li>Digital Communication</li>

					I attended my undergraduate in School of Electrical Engineering, BUPT from <b>Sept, 2005</b> to <b>June, 2009</b>.
					During these four years, I worked very hard on my course work. I got a GPA of <b>91</b> out of 100 and It was
					 a record high for our major. I consecutively ranked No.1 in our major for every semester. 
					Major courses taken including:
					<ul>
						<li>Analog Circuit Design and Laboratory</li>
						<li>Digital Circuit Design and Laboratory</li>
						<li>Communication Electronic Circuit</li>
						<li>Micro Controller</li>
						<li>Enbedded System</li>
						<li>Network Analysis</li>
						<li>Semiconductor Physics</li>
						<li>Microcomputer System</li>
						<li>Signals and Systems</li>
						<li>Communication System</li>
						<li>Computer Network</li>
						<li>C/C++ Programing</li>
						<li>Data Structure and Algorithm</li>
						<li>Database System</li>
					</ul>
					In addition, I also spent a lot of time conducting research and attending extracurricular contests.
					I worked with Prof. Hongxin Zhang during the undergraduate years and coauthored 4 research papers publishing
					on international journals. Major contests also rendered good results and rendered several outstanding prizes and scholarships.
					<ul>
						<li>The 1st prize of Beijing College-student Electronics Design Contest (2008)</li>
						<li>The 1st prize of National Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, China (2007)</li>
						<li>The 2nd prize of 18th Beijing College-student Advanced Mathematics Contest (2007)</li>
						<li>The 3nd prize of 17th Beijing College-student Advanced Mathematics Contest (2006)</li>
						<li>The 1st prize of Advanced Mathematics Contest in BUPT (2006)</li>
						<li>National Scholarship (2006, 2007, 2008)</li>
						<li>Scholarship of Bright Oceans Corporation(2006)</li>
